# web-scraping-with-python
project 1:
**description:**
This is the small sample code ,how to generate web scraping by using python.
I have used Beautiful soup library for web scrapping, 
one of the primary reasons of using this library is it is so popoular and easy to code,but the main disadvantage of this library is it is slower when compared to lxml
note:the sample url that I have taken in this code is from "filpkart"
